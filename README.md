# Iris dataset
Originally published at UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set, this dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations. 
Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.

# Purpose
This is a simple analysis I did for a university course (with correlation analysis).
